Wow, so a readme eh? 

Alright. I'll give it a shot. I stole, and then modified some javascript from
[defunkt][d]. The page was originally inspired by his site at the time, but I
have since made mine far different (and he has changed his a few times too...).

So ya, the gist is: this is the page where I list all of my projects that I am
proud to have worked on.
